In the project, there are three stakeholders: Buyer, Admin and seller.

Buyer: Buyer can register on the website and after successfully registering he/she can login on to the site. They can search products, view products and also add the products into the cart. After successfully adding the products into the cart buyer can do the payment and after the payment order has been successfully placed.

Seller: Seller can register on to the website. In registration process seller has to upload the documents such as identity proof and business card. After the approval of the admin the seller can be successfully registered on to the website. Then he can add their products, manage their products and take the order from the website and delivered that order on the address of the buyer.
